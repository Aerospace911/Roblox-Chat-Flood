# Roblox Chat Flood

# EXCESSIVELY USING THIS SCRIPT IS A BANNABLE OFFENSE (4+ Accounts). 

This is meant to be used while multiboxing.

To initiate the chat flood, push Ctrl + Shift + B.

Was used in conjunction with DNServer.py and DNClient.py to broadcast commands to other computers to perform actions at the same time. If someone asks me to release these files, I will.

The script should be self explanatory.
